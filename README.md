### Other Notes
I forgot to mention that I also did logging; I have four different kinds of logs! One for Account logins, one for routes, one for searches, and one for account creations.
Each are in their own directory for ease of access.   
   
I also forgot to mention that I have completed some jest tests. Feel free to take a look at them, or run them using 'npm test'
